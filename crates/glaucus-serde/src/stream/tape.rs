//! A replayable parser-event tape, for resolving aliases without a node tree.
//!
//! The tree path resolves an alias by cloning an already-built `Node`. A
//! streaming path has no nodes, so it must replay the **events** that built the
//! anchored value instead. That difference is the whole reason this type exists.
